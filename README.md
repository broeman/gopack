Running in Alpha, and not at all useful. At this stage it is just me tinkering. Haven't even acted professional yet.

== Planned ideas ==

0.1 Installation of a single package
* Install argument (done, maybe need some refactoring)
* Package model (done?)
* Version/dependencies model (done?)
* Linkage to install script
* Running a source installation: configure, make, make tests

0.2 TODO
